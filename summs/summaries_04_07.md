## ðŸ“„ `04_loc_autoc.py` â€” *Location Autocomplete Module*

### Key Points for Learners:

* **Encapsulation**: The class `LocationAutocomplete` wraps all logic needed to support user-friendly location search.
* **Autocomplete Logic**: Uses substring matching (`in`) to return relevant suggestions from a static list.
* **Handling Typos**: Even with a simple hardcoded list, users can explore how real-world systems like Google Maps autocomplete might scale this idea.
* **String methods**: Emphasizes `lower()` for case-insensitive matching.
* **Return formats**: Returns both display name and coordinates to simulate real-world API responses.

## ðŸ“„ `05_inter_auto.py` â€” *Interactive Autocomplete Demo*

### Key Points for Learners:

* **Command-line interaction**: Shows how to build user-facing CLI tools in Python.
* **Input validation loop**: Uses `while` loop to repeatedly prompt for location input.
* **Integration**: Demonstrates the real-world use of `LocationAutocomplete` from the previous file.
* **Suggestion logic**: Learners see feedback when no matches are found â€” promotes good user experience principles.
* **Optional user choices**: Users can cancel or choose from multiple suggestions â€” mimics frontend search dropdowns.

## ðŸ“„ `06_demo_lms.py` â€” *Location Management System*

### Key Points for Learners:

* **Class composition**: Combines several smaller components (`Validator`, `Geocoder`, etc.) into one cohesive class.
* **Persistent storage**: Demonstrates saving user preferences and location history with `json`.
* **Default/favorites/history**: Gives learners a full model of how modern weather/location apps store user-specific data.
* **Error handling**: `try/except` is used during file read/write for robust I/O.
* **Data cleaning**: Uses `.strip()` and `.lower()` to standardize inputs.
* **Search history & caching**: Introduces learners to memory/performance improvements in real apps.

## ðŸ“„ `07_weather_api_demo.py` â€” *Weather API Integration Simulation*

### Key Points for Learners:

* **Mock API logic**: Demonstrates how to simulate a real API using internal data.
* **Separation of concerns**: Clean separation between location and weather logic encourages modular programming.
* **Coordinate-based API input**: Shows how geographic data like latitude/longitude is essential for weather APIs.
* **Multi-location testing**: Runs simulation across multiple cities to highlight reusable design.
* **Feedback design**: Emphasizes printing both success and failure conditions â€” helpful in user-facing apps.
